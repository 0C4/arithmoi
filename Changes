0.4.2.0:
    This release supports GHC 7.6, 7.8 and 8.0.

    Add new cabal flag check-bounds, which replaces all unsafe array functions with safe ones.

    Add basic functions on Gaussian integers.
    Add Moebius mu-function.

    Forbid non-positive moduli in Math.NumberTheory.Moduli.

    Fix out-of-bounds error in Math.NumberTheory.Primes.Heap, Math.NumberTheory.Primes.Sieve and Math.NumberTheory.MoebiusInversion.
    Fix 32-bit build.
    Fix binaryGCD on negative numbers.
    Fix highestPower (various issues).

0.4.1.0:
    Add integerLog10 variants at Bas van Dijk's request and expose
    Math.NumberTheory.Powers.Integer, with an added integerWordPower.
0.4.0.4:
    Update for GHC-7.8, the type of some primops changed, they return Int# now
    instead of Bool.
    Fixed bugs in modular square roots and factorisation.
0.4.0.3:
    Relaxed dependencies on mtl and containers
    Fixed warnings from GHC-7.5, Word(..) moved to GHC.Types
    Removed SPECIALISE pragma from inline function (warning from 7.5, probably
    pointless anyway)
0.4.0.2:
    Sped up factor sieves. They need more space now, but the speedup is worth it, IMO.
    Raised spec-constr limit in MoebiusInversion.Int
0.4.0.1:
    Fixed Haddock bug
0.4.0.0:
    Added generalised Moebius inversion, to be continued
0.3.0.0:
    Added modular square roots and Chinese remainder theorem

    Performance tweaks for powerModInteger (~10%) and
    invertMod (~25%).
0.2.0.5:
    Fix bug in psieveFrom
0.2.0.4:
    Fix bug in nthPrime
0.2.0.3:
    Fix bug in powerMod
0.2.0.2:

0.2.0.1:
    Fix copy-pasto (only relevant for 7.3.*)
    Fix imports for ghc >= 7.3
0.2.0.0:
    Added certificates and certified testing/factorisation
0.1.0.2:
